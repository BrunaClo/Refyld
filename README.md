## Project Description

This project is the final project of the Ironhack Data Analysis Bootcamp. In this project, we worked with the database from **Refyld**.

### About Refyld :

Refyld is a company that sells, at cost price, natural, sustainable and 100% rechargeable hygienic products thanks to a simple annual membership.

### Assignment :

Our task was to conduct a leads analysis to find some insights about their clients and to better understand their social media performance. The main questions that drove us were: **Who are their clients? How many subscribers in the newsletter? What are their social media metrics? Which publication has more interactions?**

## Project Development

## Objective : 

 - Profiling Users
 - Social Media Analysis
 - Dashboard Development 

### Challenges :
The main hindrance in this project was the time constraints. One week to retrieve, gather, clean, and analyze the data. With multiple sources of data, we spent a significant amount of time selecting and collecting the information that would be useful. The development of the [dashboard](https://github.com/BrunaClo/Refyld/blob/main/refyld.py) was not possible in this delay, however, it's under construction.

## The Dataset

To accomplish our task, we used the following dataset :

  - Users' information (gender, location, type of membership, turnover, etc.)
  - Ads information (gender, age, location, click rate, etc.)
  - Newsletter (subscribers, unsubscribers, opening rate, etc.)
  - Facebook Page Insights (impression, reach, engagement, likes, talking about, etc.)
  - Facebook Post (numbers of likes, audience, publication type, etc.)
  - Instagram (followers, impressions, reach)

## Workflow

 1. Data Gathering
 2. Separating data and responsibility
 3. Data Cleaning
 4. Defining KPI
 5. Data Analysis and Data Visualization
 6. Powerpoint presentation
 7. Dashboard creation

## Some Analysis and Insights

Users are mostly women and the audience is principally women between the age of 24 and 35 years old.
